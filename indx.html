                 the full-cycle creation of a web-based product. 
                 This process usually involves designing the web pages and then bringing them 
                 to life through programming. Depending on the scope of the project, these services may include front-end,
                  back-end development, creation and optimization of text content,
                 SEO, support, etc. Basically, web development is a set of measures necessary for the launch and sustainability
                  of any given product.
                  Web development goes far beyond designing and adding functionality to the menus, buttons, and sliders. To create a
                   truly successful product, the team must build it so that the users actually enjoy their interaction. 
                   This is generally known as User Experience, and it involves working out simple and clear navigation, appropriate 
                   and readable fonts, usability, accessibility, efficiency, and much more.</p>
